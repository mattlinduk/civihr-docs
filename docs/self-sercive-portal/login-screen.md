Login screen
==========

There is one login screen for your organisation's CiviHR. Each staff member should have their individual username and password. The login screen can be tailored to your organisation by adding a logo and a welcome message. The screen also contains a link to request a new password. Staff members who want a CiviHR account can click a link on the login screen and fill in a small form to request access to your CiviHR Self Service Portal.
